answer: "Elevated ammonia level",
rationale: "Ammonia accumulation causes hepatic encephalopathy, leading to confusion and asterixis."
},

{
q: "Which assessment finding indicates early septic shock?",
options: [
"Warm flushed skin",
"Bradycardia",
"Decreased urine output",
"Hypothermia"
],
answer: "Warm flushed skin",
rationale: "Early septic shock often presents with vasodilation causing warm, flushed skin before hypotension develops."
},

{
q: "A nurse is caring for a patient with a spinal cord injury at C5. Which complication is the priority concern?",
options: [
"Autonomic dysreflexia",
"Respiratory failure",
"Urinary retention",
"Orthostatic hypotension"
],
answer: "Respiratory failure",
rationale: "High cervical injuries impair diaphragmatic function, making respiratory failure the greatest immediate risk."
},

{
q: "Which finding most strongly suggests acute blood loss?",
options: [
"Bradycardia",
"Bounding pulses",
"Decreased hematocrit",
"Narrow pulse pressure"
],
answer: "Narrow pulse pressure",
rationale: "Acute blood loss reduces preload and stroke volume, leading to a narrowed pulse pressure."
},

{
q: "A nurse is caring for a patient receiving continuous IV insulin infusion. Which parameter should be monitored MOST frequently?",
options: [
"Serum potassium",
"Blood glucose level",
"Urine ketones",
"Blood pressure"
],
answer: "Blood glucose level",
rationale: "Continuous insulin infusion requires frequent glucose monitoring to prevent hypoglycemia."
},

{
q: "Which nursing action is most appropriate when caring for a patient with increased risk of aspiration?",
options: [
"Encouraging supine positioning",
"Providing thickened liquids",
"Administering sedatives",
"Limiting oral care"
],
answer: "Providing thickened liquids",
rationale: "Thickened liquids reduce the risk of aspiration by slowing bolus flow."
},

{
q: "A patient develops sudden onset of confusion and unilateral weakness. What is the nurse’s FIRST action?",
options: [
"Administer oxygen",
"Check blood glucose",
"Notify the healthcare provider",
"Prepare for CT scan"
],
answer: "Check blood glucose",
rationale: "Hypoglycemia can mimic stroke symptoms and must be ruled out immediately."
},

{
q: "Which finding indicates effective treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis?",
options: [
"Blood glucose below 250 mg/dL",
"Urine negative for ketones",
"pH returning toward normal",
"Decreased respiratory rate"
],
answer: "pH returning toward normal",
rationale: "Resolution of metabolic acidosis is the key indicator of DKA improvement."
},

{
q: "A patient receiving opioid analgesics develops pinpoint pupils and shallow breathing. What medication should the nurse anticipate?",
options: [
"Flumazenil",
"Naloxone",
"Atropine",
"Epinephrine"
],
answer: "Naloxone",
rationale: "Naloxone reverses opioid-induced respiratory depression."
},

{
q: "Which nursing intervention best reduces the risk of catheter-associated urinary tract infection?",
options: [
"Routine catheter irrigation",
"Maintaining a closed drainage system",
"Daily catheter replacement",
"Encouraging alkaline urine"
],
answer: "Maintaining a closed drainage system",
rationale: "A closed system minimizes bacterial entry and significantly reduces infection risk."
},

{
q: "A patient with heart failure suddenly gains 2 kg in 24 hours. What is the nurse’s priority action?",
options: [
"Document the finding",
"Notify the healthcare provider",
"Restrict sodium intake",
"Encourage ambulation"
],
answer: "Notify the healthcare provider",
rationale: "Rapid weight gain indicates acute fluid retention and worsening heart failure requiring immediate evaluation."
},

{
q: "Which sign indicates worsening hypoxia?",
options: [
"Tachycardia",
"Hypertension",
"Bradycardia",
"Restlessness"
],
answer: "Bradycardia",
rationale: "Bradycardia is a late and dangerous sign of severe hypoxia."
},

{
q: "A patient with suspected meningitis presents with fever, neck stiffness, and photophobia. What is the nurse’s priority action?",
options: [
"Prepare for lumbar puncture",
"Administer antibiotics as prescribed",
"Apply cooling blankets",
"Reduce environmental stimuli"
],
answer: "Administer antibiotics as prescribed",
rationale: "Antibiotics must be started immediately to prevent neurological damage and death."
},

{
q: "Which finding indicates successful fluid resuscitation in shock?",
options: [
"Decreased heart rate",
"Increased urine output",
"Improved skin color",
"Normalized blood pressure"
],
answer: "Increased urine output",
rationale: "Improved urine output reflects restored renal perfusion and effective resuscitation."
},

{
q: "A nurse is caring for a patient with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Which intervention is most beneficial?",
options: [
"High tidal volume ventilation",
"Prone positioning",
"Fluid overload",
"Sedation minimization"
],
answer: "Prone positioning",
rationale: "Prone positioning improves oxygenation and alveolar recruitment in ARDS."
},

{
q: "Which finding indicates imminent cardiac arrest?",
options: [
"Tachycardia",
"Chest pain",
"Agonal respirations",
"Hypertension"
],
answer: "Agonal respirations",
rationale: "Agonal breathing is a sign of severe hypoxia and impending cardiac arrest."
