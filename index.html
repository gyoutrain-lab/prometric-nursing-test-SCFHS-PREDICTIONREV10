const questions = [
{
q: "A 68-year-old patient with acute ischemic stroke is admitted 2 hours after symptom onset. Which nursing action is the highest priority?",
options: [
"Maintain head of bed flat to improve cerebral perfusion",
"Administer prescribed thrombolytic after screening",
"Initiate oral feeding to prevent hypoglycemia",
"Apply intermittent pneumatic compression devices"
],
answer: "Administer prescribed thrombolytic after screening",
rationale: "Early administration of thrombolytics within the therapeutic window significantly improves neurological outcomes. Other interventions are secondary."
},

{
q: "A patient receiving enteral feeding via nasogastric tube suddenly develops coughing and dyspnea. What is the nurse’s FIRST action?",
options: [
"Stop the feeding immediately",
"Increase the feeding rate",
"Suction the airway",
"Check gastric residual volume"
],
answer: "Stop the feeding immediately",
rationale: "Coughing and dyspnea suggest aspiration. Feeding must be stopped immediately before further assessment or intervention."
},

{
q: "Which finding most strongly indicates fluid volume overload in a patient with heart failure?",
options: [
"Bounding peripheral pulses",
"Bilateral basal crackles",
"Decreased urine output",
"Elevated blood glucose"
],
answer: "Bilateral basal crackles",
rationale: "Crackles indicate pulmonary congestion from excess intravascular volume, a hallmark of fluid overload."
},

{
q: "A nurse is preparing to administer insulin glargine. Which statement is correct?",
options: [
"It can be mixed with regular insulin",
"It is administered intravenously",
"It has no pronounced peak",
"It must be given before meals"
],
answer: "It has no pronounced peak",
rationale: "Insulin glargine provides basal insulin coverage with minimal peak, reducing hypoglycemia risk."
},

{
q: "A postoperative patient suddenly becomes restless, tachycardic, and hypotensive. What complication should the nurse suspect FIRST?",
options: [
"Pulmonary embolism",
"Hypoglycemia",
"Atelectasis",
"Urinary retention"
],
answer: "Pulmonary embolism",
rationale: "Sudden hemodynamic instability and respiratory symptoms postoperatively strongly suggest pulmonary embolism."
},
,{
q: "A 55-year-old patient with chronic kidney disease is receiving IV fluids. Which assessment finding most strongly suggests fluid volume excess?",
options: [
"Dry mucous membranes",
"Jugular venous distention",
"Orthostatic hypotension",
"Decreased skin turgor"
],
answer: "Jugular venous distention",
rationale: "Jugular venous distention reflects increased central venous pressure and is a classic indicator of fluid volume excess."
},

{
q: "A nurse is caring for a patient 6 hours after thyroidectomy. Which finding requires IMMEDIATE intervention?",
options: [
"Hoarseness of voice",
"Serous drainage on dressing",
"Tingling around the mouth",
"Pain score of 6/10"
],
answer: "Tingling around the mouth",
rationale: "Perioral tingling suggests hypocalcemia from parathyroid injury, which can rapidly progress to laryngospasm and airway compromise."
},

{
q: "Which action is most appropriate when administering packed red blood cells?",
options: [
"Infuse with dextrose solution",
"Begin transfusion slowly for first 15 minutes",
"Warm blood in a microwave",
"Run transfusion over 6 hours"
],
answer: "Begin transfusion slowly for first 15 minutes",
rationale: "The first 15 minutes are critical for detecting transfusion reactions; blood must be infused slowly and monitored closely."
},

{
q: "A patient with diabetes reports sweating, tremors, and confusion. What is the nurse’s priority action?",
options: [
"Administer insulin",
"Check blood glucose level",
"Encourage deep breathing",
"Document findings"
],
answer: "Check blood glucose level",
rationale: "These are classic signs of hypoglycemia. Blood glucose must be verified immediately before treatment."
},

{
q: "Which assessment finding best indicates effective pain management after opioid administration?",
options: [
"Patient is sleeping",
"Heart rate decreased",
"Pain score reduced from 8 to 3",
"Blood pressure stabilized"
],
answer: "Pain score reduced from 8 to 3",
rationale: "Pain is subjective; the most reliable indicator of effectiveness is the patient’s reported pain reduction."
},

{
q: "A patient develops sudden chest pain and dyspnea 24 hours after surgery. Which diagnostic test is most appropriate FIRST?",
options: [
"Chest X-ray",
"CT pulmonary angiography",
"Electrocardiogram",
"Arterial blood gas"
],
answer: "CT pulmonary angiography",
rationale: "CT pulmonary angiography is the diagnostic test of choice for suspected pulmonary embolism."
},

{
q: "Which nursing intervention best prevents ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)?",
options: [
"Daily chest physiotherapy",
"Oral care with chlorhexidine",
"Routine suctioning every hour",
"Keeping patient supine"
],
answer: "Oral care with chlorhexidine",
rationale: "Evidence shows oral care with chlorhexidine significantly reduces bacterial colonization and VAP risk."
},

{
q: "A patient receiving heparin develops a sudden drop in platelet count. What complication should the nurse suspect?",
options: [
"Disseminated intravascular coagulation",
"Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia",
"Vitamin K deficiency",
"Bone marrow suppression"
],
answer: "Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia",
rationale: "Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an immune-mediated reaction causing platelet destruction and thrombosis risk."
},

{
q: "Which instruction is most important for a patient prescribed nitroglycerin sublingual tablets?",
options: [
"Swallow the tablet with water",
"Take the medication after meals",
"Store tablets in original container",
"Use only once daily"
],
answer: "Store tablets in original container",
rationale: "Nitroglycerin is unstable and must be stored properly to maintain potency."
},

{
q: "A nurse is caring for a patient with increased intracranial pressure. Which intervention is contraindicated?",
options: [
"Elevating head of bed 30 degrees",
"Maintaining neutral neck alignment",
"Suctioning as needed",
"Encouraging coughing exercises"
],
answer: "Encouraging coughing exercises",
rationale: "Coughing increases intrathoracic and intracranial pressure, worsening ICP."
},

{
q: "Which finding most strongly suggests hypovolemic shock?",
options: [
"Warm, flushed skin",
"Bounding pulse",
"Narrow pulse pressure",
"Increased urine output"
],
answer: "Narrow pulse pressure",
rationale: "Hypovolemia causes decreased preload and cardiac output, leading to narrowed pulse pressure."
},

{
q: "A patient with COPD is receiving oxygen therapy. Which oxygen saturation target is most appropriate?",
options: [
"100%",
"96–98%",
"88–92%",
"Above 98%"
],
answer: "88–92%",
rationale: "COPD patients rely on hypoxic drive; excessive oxygen can suppress respiration."
},

{
q: "Which sign indicates early sepsis?",
options: [
"Hypotension",
"Bradycardia",
"Altered mental status",
"Warm flushed skin"
],
answer: "Altered mental status",
rationale: "Early sepsis often presents with subtle neurological changes before overt hemodynamic collapse."
},

{
q: "A nurse is preparing to insert an indwelling urinary catheter. Which step is essential to prevent infection?",
options: [
"Using clean gloves",
"Inflating balloon before insertion",
"Maintaining sterile technique",
"Positioning patient supine"
],
answer: "Maintaining sterile technique",
rationale: "Strict aseptic technique is the most critical measure to prevent catheter-associated urinary tract infections."
},

{
q: "Which electrolyte imbalance places a patient at greatest risk for cardiac dysrhythmias?",
options: [
"Hyponatremia",
"Hypocalcemia",
"Hyperkalemia",
"Hypophosphatemia"
],
answer: "Hyperkalemia",
rationale: "Elevated potassium directly affects cardiac conduction and can cause life-threatening arrhythmias."
},

{
q: "A patient is receiving morphine IV. Which assessment finding requires immediate action?",
options: [
"Respiratory rate of 10/min",
"Nausea",
"Constipation",
"Mild itching"
],
answer: "Respiratory rate of 10/min",
rationale: "Respiratory depression is the most dangerous adverse effect of opioids and requires immediate intervention."
},

{
q: "Which nursing action best prevents pressure injuries in an immobile patient?",
options: [
"Massaging bony prominences",
"Repositioning every 2 hours",
"Applying heat packs",
"Restricting fluid intake"
],
answer: "Repositioning every 2 hours",
rationale: "Frequent repositioning relieves pressure and is the most effective prevention strategy."
},

{
q: "Which finding indicates successful endotracheal tube placement?",
options: [
"Equal bilateral chest expansion",
"Condensation in tube",
"Improved oxygen saturation",
"Ability to speak"
],
answer: "Equal bilateral chest expansion",
rationale: "Symmetrical chest rise confirms proper tracheal placement rather than esophageal intubation."
},

{
q: "A patient with liver cirrhosis is at greatest risk for which complication?",
options: [
"Hypercoagulation",
"Hypoglycemia",
"Bleeding",
"Hypertension"
],
answer: "Bleeding",
